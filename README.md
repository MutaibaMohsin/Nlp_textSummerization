Text summarization is a fundamental task in NLP, with the aim of condense
large bodies of text into shorter, meaningful summaries. This project implements an extractive summarization approach using Pythonâ€™s NLTK library.
The system processes input text, calculates word frequencies, and scores sentences to identify the most significant ones. The code handles pre-processing,
edge cases, and supports customization of summary length.
The model used in this project leverages the concept of Term Frequency
(TF), a component of the TF-IDF model. Term Frequency measures the
frequency of a term (word) within a document, highlighting the importance
of frequently occurring terms in that specific context. However, this implementation does not incorporate the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
component, which measures the importance of a term across a corpus of
documents. As a result, the summarization focuses solely on word frequency
within the input text, without contextual adjustments from a broader corpus
perspective.
The focus of this implementation is on simplicity and clarity, making
it accessible for educational and practical purposes. The summarizer can
be integrated into larger NLP pipelines or used as a standalone tool for
summarization tasks. Additionally, the modularity of the code allows easy
adaptation for various text processing applications.
